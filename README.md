##Explanation

VMX requires a few files/folder to be available:
 - Matlab Dependency
 - Mount points for:
   - Session Information
   - Local Model storage
 - Certain open source libraries

The VMX Docker manager is a set of sane defaults and configurations that store user data (session and models) in seperate volumes at /vmx/sessions and /vmx/models; and loads the binaries into /vmx/build.  Those mount points, along with the matlab MCR dependency are run within the context of an Ubuntu 14.04 with the required libraries.

The dockerfiles that build the referenced dockers can be found here: https://github.com/VISIONAI/vmx-public-docker
